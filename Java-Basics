1Q.  How to create a class, object, method and its signature ?
Ans. If we want to create a class named cls with some statement we write like:
        public class cls {
                   Statements;
                        }
     If we want to create an object we can create inside the main function of the program which is like:
          cls myObj = new cls();
       we can create multiple Objects to a class at a time by different object names.
     Methos functon is create outside of main function and then we call it in the main function which is like:
                      public class cls {
                          static void myMethod() {
                           System.out.println("Wishes from Mohan");
                            }
  
                         public static void main(String[] args) {
                          myMethod();
                            }
                           }
2Q.   Write a program to print your name ?
Ans.                    public class cls {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                           System.out.println("Saya Mohan");
                              }
                            }
3Q.   Write a program for a Single line comment, multi-line and documentation comments ?
Ans.        Single line command : Entry level programmer used mostly the single line comments:
                                class cls
                                    {
                                       public static void main(String args[])
                                         {
                                         System.out.println("Single line comment");
                                            }
                                           }
             Multiple line comments: we can write Mutli line comment by using "//" in that beginning will be like " /* " and ends with " */ "
                                            class cls {
                                              public static void main(String args[])
                                                {
                                        System.out.println("Multi line comments below");
                                               /*Comment line 1
                                                 Comment line 2
                                                 Comment line 3*/
                                                }
                                              }
 4Q.   Define variables for different Data Types int, Boolean, char, float, double and print on the Console ?
 Ans.                   int a = 2, b = 4, c = 6;
                        float pi = 3.14f;
                        double do = 20.22d;
                        char a = ’v’;
                        Boolean = yes or no
 5Q.   Define the local and Global variables with the same name and print both variables and understand the scope of the variables ?
 Ans.  Local Variable is defined as a type of variable declared within programming block. It can only be used inside the code block
       in which it is declared. The local variable exists until the block of the function is under execution. After that, it will be
       destroyed automatically.
                        public int add(){
                          int a =4;
                          int b=5;
                          return a+b;
                              }                      
                where a and b are variables.
       A Global Variable in the program is a variable defined outside the function. It has a global scope means it holds its value
       throughout the lifetime of the program. Hence, it can be accessed throughout the program by any function defined within the 
       program, unless it is shadowed.
                      int a =4;
                      int b=5;
                      public int add(){
                        return a+b;
                          }
 6Q.    Write a function to print your name and call the function from main method ?
 Ans.                 public class cls {
                        static void myMethod() {
                          System.out.println("Iam Saya Mohan");
                           }
                      public static void main(String[] args) {
                             myMethod();
                               }
                             }
